The app features a modern and user-friendly interface that showcases trailers in a modal UI. The app utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling, which provides a wide range of customization options and makes it easy to implement responsive design. The integration with [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-US) provides access to a vast library of movies, including trailers, plot descriptions, and more. Users can search for and stream movies seamlessly, and the modal UI provides an immersive experience for watching trailers.
